# Flood Level Prediction using LSTM

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project on Github! ðŸŒŸ

## Project Overview

In this project, I've explored leveraging artificial intelligence for predicting flood levels using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Predicting flood levels accurately can significantly aid in disaster preparedness and response efforts.

### Key Highlights

- **Objective:** Develop an accurate model for forecasting flood levels based on historical data.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib.
- **Methodology:** Utilized LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies in the data.

## Performance Metrics

- **Training RMSE:** 0.05
- **Testing RMSE:** 0.02
- **New Test Set RMSE:** 0.16

## Impact & Insights

By harnessing the power of deep learning, we can provide timely and accurate predictions of flood levels. Extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering were crucial in enhancing model accuracy and performance.

## Next Steps

- Continuously refine the model to handle extreme flood events and improve overall robustness.
- Explore additional features and data sources to further enhance prediction capabilities.
